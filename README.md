# WHETHER, SWEATER


## Project Information
_Whether, Sweater_ is the final individual project for the Module 3 within Turing School of Software Design's Backend program. The project is a representation of the backend of a service-oriented designed application that provides a frontend with data pertaining to weather and travel data, communicated through various APIs.

## Learning Goals

  * Consume external APIs

  * Build API's that return JSON responses

  * Refactor code for better code for improved organization/readability

  * Practice project management with project boards/daily standups/group retros

  * Utilize workflow: small commits, descriptive pull requests and code review

  * Write thorough and understandable documentation
  
  
  ## APIs
  To use this application, you will need to access to one unique API keys from each of these three sources:
  
https://developer.mapquest.com/documentation/geocoding-api/

https://developer.mapquest.com/documentation/directions-api/

https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api

https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/bing/apis/bing-image-search-api

The Bing one is a but tricky. Two APIs wiil be called from Mapquest. API endpoint documentation is available on each site.
